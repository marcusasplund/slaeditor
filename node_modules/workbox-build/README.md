# workbox-build

A module that integrates into your build process, helping you generate a
manifest of local files that [`workbox-sw`](../workbox-sw) should precache.
It can also scaffold a full service worker implementation for you.

While you can use this module directly, there are both
[command-line](../workbox-cli) and [Webpack](../workbox-webpack-plugin)
wrappers.

## Installation

npm install --save-dev workbox-build
